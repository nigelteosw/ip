# User Guide
Welcome to CorkyNotes! CorkyNotes is a desktop app for managing your tasks, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, CorkyNotes can get your task management done faster than traditional GUI apps.



## Features


### Create different tasks
CorkyNotes supports 4 different types of tasks:

- Todos
- Deadlines
- Events
- Period Tasks

1. Todos
Todos are tasks with a description and completion status.

2. Deadlines
Deadlines are tasks with a description, due date, and completion status.

3. Events
Events are tasks with a description, from date, to date, and completion status.

4. Period Tasks
Period Taks are tasks with a description, from date, to date, and completion status. Period Tasks are similar to that of Event tasks.


### View your tasks
Forgot what you added? Corky tracks them for you. You can even mark and delete task as and when they are completed.


Prefer CLI to GUI?
java -jar ip-0.2.jar -mode cli to switch to CLI mode.

java -jar ip-0.2.jar -mode gui or simply java -jar ip-0.2.jar to use the GUI instead.
